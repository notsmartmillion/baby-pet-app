## People-Detection Guardrail

**Why?**
- Avoid processing human likeness (ethical/legal risk)
- Reduce biometric data concerns (GDPR/BIPA)
- Simplify privacy disclosures

**Implementation** (stub in `services/worker-gpu/pipeline.py`):

```python
def detect_people(image_path: str) -> bool:
    # Option 1: MediaPipe Face Detection
    # Option 2: YOLOv8 person detection
    # Option 3: AWS Rekognition / Google Vision API
    
    # Return True if people detected
    return has_faces or has_people
```

**User experience:**
```
‚ùå "We detected people in this photo. Please upload only pet photos."
```

---

## Data Breach Plan

If user data is compromised:

1. **Contain**: Shut down compromised service
2. **Assess**: What data was exposed?
3. **Notify**:
   - GDPR: Within 72h to supervisory authority
   - CCPA: Without unreasonable delay
   - Users: If high risk to their rights
4. **Document**: Keep records of breach, response, timeline

---

## International Data Transfers (EU ‚Üí US)

If you process EU user data in the US (e.g., AWS us-east-1):

- Use **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** with AWS
- Mention in Privacy Policy: "We transfer data to the US under SCCs"
- Consider using **EU regions** (AWS eu-west-1) for EU users
