## 🔨 Stubs (Easy to Implement)

These have stubs that work - just plug in the real implementation:

### 1. AI Model (Highest Priority)
**Location**: `services/worker-gpu/pipeline.py`

**Current**: Returns original image (for testing)

**To Implement** (~2-4 hours):
```python
# Load models
from diffusers import StableDiffusionXLPipeline
from ip_adapter import IPAdapter

MODEL = StableDiffusionXLPipeline.from_pretrained(...)
ip_adapter = IPAdapter(MODEL, "ip-adapter.bin")
MODEL.load_lora_weights("kitten-puppy-lora")

# Generate
images = ip_adapter.generate(
    pil_image=reference_images,
    prompt=f"cute {petType} baby, adorable",
    negative_prompt="adult, old, human"
)
```

### 2. Authentication
**Current**: Uses `x-user-id` header (works for testing)

**To Implement** (~1 hour):
```typescript
// Install Clerk
npm install @clerk/clerk-expo
npm install @clerk/fastify

// Mobile: Wrap with ClerkProvider
// API: Add auth middleware
```

### 3. RevenueCat IAP
**Current**: Mock purchases work in UI

**To Implement** (~1 hour):
```bash
# Install SDK
npm install @revenuecat/purchases-react-native

# Uncomment code in:
# - apps/mobile/src/hooks/usePurchases.ts
# - apps/mobile/app/_layout.tsx
```

### 4. People Detection
**Current**: Always passes (for testing)

**To Implement** (~2 hours):
```python
# Option 1: MediaPipe
import mediapipe as mp
face_detection = mp.solutions.face_detection.FaceDetection()

# Option 2: YOLO
from ultralytics import YOLO
model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')
results = model(image)
```
